= this is a poem of discovery of the gradual emergence of the sense of spring from what looks otherwise like a disease of winter . the contagious hospital is both a colloquial usage by doctors and patients for the longer name and a hospital that is itself contagious that leaks its presence out onto the road . the cold wind will be revealed as a spring wind but not before the poem s complex act of noticing has been completed . the meter here is a typographic strip about ems wide with a general tendency to break syntax at tight points lines and are normal rather than exceptional but notice the traditional use of discovery enjambment in lines and under the surge of the blue because of its audible dactylic melody aims the syntax at a noun version of blue a metonymy for sky . but the next line discovers its mere adjectival use appositively with mottled and

= the consequences of yeats s turn to the visionary are perhaps nowhere more evident than in his diction . during his symbolist period the poetic image is a creation of the mind his style consequently is quite opaque and his diction ornate . during his crisis he retreats to the low register in which words signify things only his language is plain but desiccated emptied of any meaning besides mere actuality . in the cold heaven we can see these two styles merging . although the poetic image is once again a thing of the mind it is not mind created . as a visitation of the great memory yeats insists the image is as real as any worldly fact . pictures in the mind he comments in a diary seem to be of two kinds we become aware of those of the first kind when some symbol . . . has descended to us and when we ourselves have passed through a shifting of the threshold consciousness

=  veiled by metaphors and changing tone the eroticism of this poem has not been fully unappreciated . the poem works and partly disguises itself by means of contrasts between subject and imagery and by distraction as the bumbling speaker progresses through interruptive rhetorical excursions and returns . emotionally he rings the changes from erotic adulation through nonchalance to petulance . having begun in a metaphorical vein he feels obliged to continue inventing metaphors and the obligation strains his patience . he makes mistakes which frustrate him and distract the reader from his subject a woman s lower extremities . this is a portrait only from the waist down and it begins at least as a love poem in the renaissance mode of direct address comparing body parts to aspects of nature . the initial metaphor is appletrees for thighs . blossoms above the trunks suggest

= williams s poetry at this time also shows him working against the conventional paradigm of the male creator a paradigm encouraged by ezra pound and the poetic tradition alike . often williams undercuts the masculine claim to mastery and control he presents in romance moderne and in reading his works alongside loy s vehement satires of masculine authority the often discussed sexuality of his poetry opens into a larger issue of gendered power informing his most radical cultural visions . williams consciously downplays what loy had called the indisputable male voice of the artist and moreover loy s example provides williams with a way of recognizing his own participation in a culture that privileges male authority . this recognition characterizes a number of his poems about women that focus upon female vulnerability to forms of masculine power while signaling his own culpability

> call the roller of big cigars the muscular one and bid him whip in kitchen cups concupiscent curds . let the wenches dawdle in such dress as they are used to wear and let the boys bring flowers in last month s newspapers . let be be finale of seem . the only emperor is the emperor of ice cream . take from the dresser of deal lacking the three glass knobs that sheet on which she embroidered fantails once and spread it so as to cover her face . if her horny feet protrude they come to show how cold she is and dumb . let the lamp affix its beam . the only emperor is the emperor of ice cream .
=  at the heart of many of stevens s poems are harsh and unpalatable experiences revealed only gradually through his intense stylization . the famous poem the emperor of ice cream resisted explication for some decades perhaps because no one took the trouble to deduce its implicit narrative from its stylized plot . the russian formalist distinction between story and plot is often useful for this and other stevens poems . the basic story of the emperor is that of a person who goes to the house of a neighbor a poor old woman who has died the person is to help lay out arrange for decent viewing the corpse in the bedroom while other neighbors are sending over homegrown flowers and yet others are preparing food including ice cream for the wake . stevens plots this story into two equal stanzas one for the kitchen where the ice cream is being made one for the

> the heron billed pale cattle birds that feed on some foul parasite of the moroccan flocks and herds cross the narrow straits to light in the rich midnight of the garden trees till the dawn break upon those mingled seas . often at evening when a boy would i carry to a friend hoping more substantial joy did an older mind commend not such as are in newton s metaphor but actual shells of rosses level shore . greater glory in the sun an evening chill upon the air bid imagination run much on the great questioner what he can question what if questioned i can with a fitting confidence reply .
= this poem almost demands that is to say the complement or antinomy of the more humbled and chastened consideration the matter receives elsewhere in the winding stair in the poem at algeciras a meditation upon death where this coldly forbidding theatre is replaced by the far more arresting and distressing shapes of self examination and self rebuke . that poem s final stanza stages another judgemental encounter now between the poem s speaker and the minatory figure of the great questioner greater glory in the sun an evening chill upon the air bid imagination run much on the great questioner what he can question what if questioned i can with a fitting confidence reply . the line man has created death in death is uttered with an apparently great confidence whether fitting or not but here antithetically the speaker is put in a position of anxiety about how answers

=  to see what this unity of being might mean take the heaven evoked in the late poem solitaire under the oaks in the oblivion of cards one exists among pure principles . neither the cards nor the trees nor the air persist as facts . this is an escape to principium to meditation . one knows at last what to think about and thinks about it without consciousness under the oak trees completely released . facts do not persist in this earthly paradise because simply thinking of things as facts implies an objective perspective contrasted to a subjective one and stevens wants there to be no such split of self and world . so the person playing cards thinks without consciousness as if such thinking were a way of being at one with the world yet is still completely released rather than being a blank transcription of the world s processes . it is a poem which spans the oppositions
