=  pound s new style in lustra was due in part to his reconciliation with whitman or more accurately to his giving freer rein to the whitman in himself . he had recognized and suppressed this aspect of his poetic personality since the date of his essay on what i feel about walt whitman . there he admitted the vital part of my message taken from the sap and fibre of america is the same as his . mentaly i am a walt whitman who has learned to wear a colar and a dress shirt although at times inimical to both . the image was apt for he distrusted whitman s nakedness and considered him something of an artistic barbarian . now whitman was not an artist he declared in another mood you cannot call a man an artist until he shows himself capable of reticence and restraint . . . . pound s attitude toward whitman was highly ambivalent . the ambivalence is reflected in

=  laughter and playfulness are the signs of like minds in the early poem to a prize bird originally titled to bernard shaw a prize bird you suit me well for you can make me laugh nor are you blinded by the chaff that every wind sends spinning from the rick . you know to think and what you think you speak with much of samson s pride and bleak finality and none dare bid you stop . pride sits you well so strut colossal bird .no barnyard makes you look absurd your brazen claws are staunch against defeat . the poem opens with a declaration of commonality couched in terms of humor the bird s capacity for making the speaker laugh is proof that they are well suited to each other . the bird s resistance to blinding by chaff suggests that the speaker s laughter is not at the bird s expense laughter is not simply a reaction to absurdity but rather requires thought

> a sudden blow the great wings beating still above the staggering girl her thighs caressed by the dark webs her nape caught in his bill he holds her helpless breast upon his breast . how can those terrified vague fingers push the feathered glory from her loosening thighs ? and how can body laid in that white rush but feel the strange heart beating where it lies ? a shudder in the loins engenders there the broken wall the burning roof and tower and agamemnon dead . being so caught up so mastered by the brute blood of the air did she put on his knowledge with his power before the indifferent beak could let her drop ?
= leda and the swan first written in had an emblematic status for yeats for he rewrote and republished the sonnet several times throughout his career . the final version published in the tower in will be used in this essay not because it is assumed that this is the authoritative version but because it is the most interrogative and the most violent . george bornstein examines the bibliographic history of the poem in how to read a page modernism and material textuality . he notes how yeats progressively replaced exclamation marks with question marks in each revision of the poem and made the violence of the swan more explicit through such lines as a sudden blow the great wings beating still which originally read as a rush a sudden wheel and hovering still bornstein . as yeats intensified the violence of the sonnet he also seemed to signal his

=  nineteen hundred and nineteen published in in the tower is a long six part sequence of lines a work too massive to be understood without study and reflection . it was in part occasioned by the guerrilla conflicts in ireland during and between republicans and the british police aided by the black and tans an irregular military group so named from their uniform composed mostly of men demobilized from the war . these conflicts anticipated the outbreak of civil war between republicans and free staters in . but it must be recalled in order to understand yeat s concern with violence in nineteen hundred and nineteen that the poem was written in the wake of world war i with its catastrophic rupture of the european status quo . the formal organization of nineteen hundred and nineteen outlined more fully in the appendix to this chapter appears

=  veiled by metaphors and changing tone the eroticism of this poem has not been fully unappreciated . the poem works and partly disguises itself by means of contrasts between subject and imagery and by distraction as the bumbling speaker progresses through interruptive rhetorical excursions and returns . emotionally he rings the changes from erotic adulation through nonchalance to petulance . having begun in a metaphorical vein he feels obliged to continue inventing metaphors and the obligation strains his patience . he makes mistakes which frustrate him and distract the reader from his subject a woman s lower extremities . this is a portrait only from the waist down and it begins at least as a love poem in the renaissance mode of direct address comparing body parts to aspects of nature . the initial metaphor is appletrees for thighs . blossoms above the trunks suggest

=  the hour before dawn again involves debate this time between a crippled beggar and the sleeping man he stumbles on . goban s oblivion inducing beer provides a link with the grey rock . the beggar is at first tempted by the idea of sleeping until better weather arrives but bridles when the sleeper complains of the noises which occasionally disturb him and suggests that to be active in the world is foolish . the sleeper claims to demonstrate the fact that the wishing away of uncomfortable circumstances is the beginning of a slippery slope . his growing preference for sleep demonstrates what the beggar does not know that his own wish for winter to pass is the trace of a deeper wish held by all life for its own ending for oblivion .so the sleeper s argument can be compared to that of edain s former husband in that he suggests the futility of suspending the inevitable in this

= a poem by williams called poem to say how little and how much it presumes features a cat stepping down over a jam closet into an empty flower pot . carefully recorded first the right foot carefully and then the hind . . . the movement is that of a living thing among objects the familiar alive as the cat is alive and the empty flower pot is not . with that connection objects suddenly become luminous as if the empty pot were actually filled awkwardly comically with tangible life . in a distinct geometry of existence the first two stanzas climb up and over the last two stepping down . the jam closet has a function of course sheltering sweets just as the pot in future or past contains flowers . but this is background for the cat and his cat life . in a cat s intense life climbing and descending for that matter even sitting and sleeping are dramatic actions . but then

=  perhaps the most immediately striking aspect of williams poems is their appeal to the visual imagination . in a survey williams responded that his strongest characteristic was his sight and went on to affirm his ability to be drunk with a sudden realization of things others never notice . we can see this attention to physical detail in many of his poems a poem like young sycamore for example is almost entirely composed of physical details presented in sparse hard edged language . parts of the physical world that might appear inconsequential to another poet are often what williams chooses to highlight . here for example williams delights in the young tree whose round and firm trunk between the wet pavement and the gutter where water is trickling and the young branches on all sides hung with cocoons . as j . hillis miller has suggested

=  most of the poems in the tower confront the problems of physical aging . sailing to byzantium seeks to evade the impermanence of the present world by escaping into a separate world of art . the poem articulates this theme by developing a set of interwoven contrasts between youth and age physicality and spirituality life and art and mortal life and eternal existence . because of the richly elaborated echoing and reechoing of contrasts the poem is at once vivid and subtle emphatic and complex . the opening stanza sets old men against the young i in one another s arms . this contrast of ages is emphasized both by the fecundity of the young and the inevitable demise that awaits whatever is begotten born and dies . the birds in the trees sing sensual music praising the natural process of procreation birth and death . but the old man who narrates the poem prefers monuments
