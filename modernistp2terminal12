= though separated by decades from the indian to his love sailing to byzantium is the most complex manifestation of yeats s anti utopian aesthetic . his earlier personal utopias were substitutes for an idealized ireland but his decadent distrust of perfection and the false promises of progress led the younger yeats to subtly subvert his own nationalist desires . in sailing the aged poet tries to leave the dream of a perfect ireland behind in favor of a city that symbolically represents immortal art . the poem famously opens with a renunciation of the imperfect world of life and death the real and troubled ireland where all neglect monuments of unageing intellect . such a place is no country for old men and cannot stand as the sole object of utopian desire . compelled by a longing for immortality and artistic perfection the speaker sails to what richard ellmann calls yeats s

= perhaps most touching of all is politics often positioned as the last poem in the collected poems which has the elder poet listening to the talk of international politics and simply stating that he cannot concentrate on such matters when all he wants is to have his youth back and embrace the beautiful girl who is standing nearby . he is an old lecher with a love on every wind as he described one of his alter egos elsewhere . what is so alluring about the poem is that it says little more than my paraphrase here . it is utterly simple demanding none of the complex intellectual responses necessary when reading say the tower and yet its poignancy depends on our knowledge of the majestic difficult poems which preceded politics . it is dashed off with nonchalance and style expressing in a straightforward manner what was said with troubled brilliance elsewhere .

= stevens s remarks as well as the style he adopted suggest that his early poems continued his insistence that poetry was part of the world . the reality he claims for poetry is twofold . there is first the process by which the world is known including both imaginative projection and the human urge for truths and closure the blessed rage for order . there is also an implicit appeal to the flux that characterizes the self and the natural world . life is rapid as stevens says he adds that the self consists of endless images . insofar as human observation and that which is observed are both characterized as processes stevens s early identification of poets as observers is not brought into question by the poetics informing his first two volumes of poetry . his early celebration of commonplace specific details however is difficult to reconcile with the poetry and poetics of . t

= the flowers are children of the sea . but what is the sea itself ? in the helmsman it becomes a titanic being willful and hypnotic who seems to personify a not unwelcome threat of death . the shepherds who speak the poem flee the helmsman . they hurry inland and lovingly catalogue the wild beauties of the shore oak hyssop bramble acorn cups . they revel among the acorn cups and dip their ankles in the leaf mould . but they yearn for something beyond the land something which only the sea holds for them a harsh kind of peace probably death itself . finally they desert their flocks and set sail but now our boat climbs hesitates drops . . . . o be swift we have always known you wanted us .

= donald dickinson saw the first verse of the weary blues as an alliterative innovation in the style of lindsay s the congo . however the verse with its references to crooning its strategic repetition of the lazy sway line and its description of a blues performer and his playing seems to derive partly from the vaudeville blues tradition as well . for example richard m . jones s jazzin baby blues recorded in by alberta hunter and by ethel waters and in by king oliver and by eva taylor discussed the way that old piano man he sure can jazz em some jazzin baby blues are drivin me insane there s nothin to them but that lonesome blue refrain . but when that cornet and that flute begin to play just make me get right up and throw myself away . just play those jazzin baby blues for me all night and day . bessie smith s recording of fletcher henderson s jazzbo brown
