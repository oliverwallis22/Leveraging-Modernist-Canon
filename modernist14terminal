= in poem viii when von hugel takes up the soul s part it becomes clearer that the poet is at the mercy finally of his own nature as the ironic epiphanies of iv and v already have shown . it makes sense the poet says to choose belief since then his heart might find relief . but this point sets up an interesting crisis in which his better judgment and so to speak his whole being are at odds with each other . it is clear too that the issue is not one of invidiously modern skepticism . that is why he goes to such elaborate lengths to credit the miracles of saint teresa s exhumation it raises the question of why if he accepts the miracles and honors sanctity he cannot as well go on to walk with salvation within the fire . for all the bravura tone of these last lines he is still left oddly volitionless choosing in the end only the condition over which he has no choice . shr

=  reconciliation suggests the renewal of what was taken away by maud gonne s marriage to john macbride . together with no second troy and a woman homer sung though it looks back to an even earlier version of maud gonne . one might say that this earlier version has been subsumed by the image of her created in the poems . it has also been overtaken by the events of her life . the reassimilation of the flesh and blood maud gonne to the figure who maintains such a strong grip on his imagination is impossible no matter how intimate and affectionate the relationship becomes between the yeats and the flesh and blood maud gonne who exist in . the movement from celebration to anxiety and sadness in reconciliation also marks a recognition of the belatedness of the new intimacy in their relationship .

= in spite of the elegy s overall movement toward identification with the rebels the next stanza distinguishes their work from the poet s . with their one purpose alone the rebels have become a stone the opposite of the running stream the tumbling clouds horse rider birds moorhens morcocks everv living thing that changess in the pastoral landscape . the stone cannot be an image of this poem s lyric stasis since there is nothing static about the lyric except for the momentary pauses in the refrains and even these are about metamorphosis . unlike such stilled elegies as her courtesy and beautiful lofty things this restless lyric tries to be the transformation it describes .

= poetry the most famous and the most direct poem addressing the question of the genuine in art provides the best starting point for defining moore s usage . though critics have long taken this poem as a statement of moore s poetic few have really confronted its peculiar procedures and examples . moore s brilliant solution imaginary gardens with real toads in them is often quoted but the prestidigitation that produced it is rarely traced . in fact moore never really does define poetry or the genuine but through the labyrinths of ambivalence and ambiguity skeptical restraints and imaginative leaps she presents her conception of their relationship . she posits an ideal in which the genuine is absorbed into form reference into poem the real into the imaginary . in the meantime poetry turns out to be a magic trick that does not quite succeed but which absorbs us in its dazzling slei

= queen anne s lace also questions the subordination of floral imagery to female attributes . poets have so often tended to link women with flowers that it has become a cultural commonplace one so well established that the association has become automatic . but williams forestalls that automatic cultural reflex . he begins with a negation rather than an affirmation her body is not so white as . . . he then begins removes the woman s body from the insubstantial and decorative floral confines and asks us to think in terms of a field . later he drops that for a larger metaphor the field plus the flowers in the field . it may be that williams aims to revive an archaic comprehension of the earth as a goddess an interpretation that poets had long since discarded . we also find a suggestion of class struggle in the poem . queen anne s lace comes fourth in a quartet of poems about flowers but i

= the impact of the arrow is of a shock of realization . it arises from the contrast envisioned in the mind s eye between her current kinder appearance and manner and her suddenly remembered dazzling very young womanhood when she was delicate in colour as apple blossom . beyond this contrast the poem hints strongly at a reason the poet could weep at this memory . what else can the reason be but regret for a love relationship long past ?

= there is a variation on this theme in the fisherman in the same collection where yeats conjures up a man of the west who has this secret discipline of the land . but yeats also admits that he is a man who does not exist i a man who is but a dream . the admission that the farmer peasant of the gaelic revival does not exist comes near the very end of the poem only four lines remain . most other poets would slow fade after such a deflationary tactic yeats however rallies more powerfully again crying out before i am old i i shall have written him one i poem maybe as cold i and passionate as the dawn . there is a pleasing exactitude to the description of the dawn as cold . the adjective also indicates the reserves of control which yeats brings to the business of passion . in our age we associate passion with an abandonment of form control and more generally tradition for yea

= in no second troy for example the poet blames the beloved for filling his days with misery but he also justifies her conduct as if subliminally thanking her for the misery that produces the blame and hence the poem . richard ellmann usefully identifies the poem s general movement in its four questions it modulates from blame to justification . on closer inspection we discover that even the first part of the first question already justifies and blames at the same time why should i blame her that she filled my days with misery . . . ? as blame it splits grammatically into question and answer separated by the caesura and joined by a causative that why should i blame her ? that she filled my days with misery . but it is also a full question since the misery like the despair in the scholars is precisely what produces poetry this poem in particular why sh

= in the remarkable poem the snow man steven dramatizes the action of a mind as it becomes one with the scene it perceives and at that instant the mind having ceased to bring something of itself to the scene the scene then ceases to exist fully . we with the one of the poem begin by watching the winter scene while in our mind the connotations of misery and cold brought forth by the scene are stirring . but gradually almost imperceptibly we are divested of whatever it is that distinguishes us from the snow man . we become the snow man and we see the winter world through his eyes of coal and we know the cold without the thoughts of human discomfort . to perceive the winter scene truly we must have the mind of the snow man until correspondence becomes identification . then we see with the sharpest eye the images of winter pine trees crusted with snow junipers shagged with ice

= some difficulty in finding a satisfying reading of the the grey rock arises from the obvious appeal of the heroic action of the warrior whom aoife loves in the story it tells . but the appeal to this form of the heroic is the popular appeal the poet rejects in allowing his story to do justice to the appeal of physical heroism the poet stresses the difficulty of this rejection . the poem compares maud gonne to aoife and so the poet keeps faith with his muse with art rather than being seduced by the appeal of the heroic which would have kept him in better repute with the mass of the people . maud gonne herself of course sought to involve herself in mass politics . she saw herself though as the soul of the crowd . she wrote this in a reply to yeats s appeal to her not to marry john macbride and not to become a catholic . his draft letter to her on this indicates the belief that her

= williams poem transitional shows his critical interest in gender and his wary elucidation of the scene of writing . the opening of the poem first he said it is the woman in us that makes us write is an attention grabbing proposition one friend argues to the other a wcw or i is the more dubious that their writing is enabled by gender mobility and doubleness . dare you make this your propaganda ? is the shocked response williams . provocatively we are not men therefore we can speak . we are conscious of the two sides gender being imagined as a binary formulation that artists weave together selectively and androgynously . we are accurate like men not women we are unbent by the sensual as women would be . this third space is transitional that is built of an oscillatory movement across terms combining the benefits of maleness and

= her contemporary poem hyacinth moves with intention from the chaste austerity of wild flora to a prodigal garden . this topographical transition from a mountain ice ridge to a hothouse atmosphere is also marked by a shift of colour from white to red the red spoil of grape and pomegranate the red camellia the most most red rose collected . as the emotions develop from restrained desire to physical passion sight gives way to the sense of smell the deep infolded spice of carnations and the unmistakable fragrance of the late tuberose . laity interprets the polarities of this poem in terms of the tension between an obliterating predatory heterosexuality and a pure inspir ing homo erotic love within a single consciousness romantic . however this implies a conformity to pater s schema that was doubtful at this stage of h .d . s career .

= in poem viii when von hugel takes up the soul s part it becomes clearer that the poet is at the mercy finally of his own nature as the ironic epiphanies of iv and v already have shown . it makes sense the poet says to choose belief since then his heart might find relief . but this point sets up an interesting crisis in which his better judgment and so to speak his whole being are at odds with each other . it is clear too that the issue is not one of invidiously modern skepticism . that is why he goes to such elaborate lengths to credit the miracles of saint teresa s exhumation it raises the question of why if he accepts the miracles and honors sanctity he cannot as well go on to walk with salvation within the fire . for all the bravura tone of these last lines he is still left oddly volitionless choosing in the end only the condition over which he has no choice . shr

= hyacinth s alternative landscape of mountain and sea ledge to which apollo imaginatively retreats forms an exhilarating contrast to the stasis of the deadly swales of predatory passion . apollo s visionary landscape associates the upper regions both high and expansive with the inviolate homoerotic attachment to hyacinth and his reverie generates images of transformation creative erotic intensity and renewal . while apollo complains that hyacinth s death has left him feeling worthless weary world bedraggled nevertheless he asserts to mountains still the rain falls on the tangle of dead under brush freshens the loam the earth and broken leaves for that hoar frost of later star or flower the fragile host of greek anemones . cp the lower paradise is merely seasonal but the mountain haunt perpetually renews itself apparently cast out dead underbrush hyacinth will

= most of the poems in the tower confront the problems of physical aging . sailing to byzantium seeks to evade the impermanence of the present world by escaping into a separate world of art . the poem articulates this theme by developing a set of interwoven contrasts between youth and age physicality and spirituality life and art and mortal life and eternal existence . because of the richly elaborated echoing and reechoing of contrasts the poem is at once vivid and subtle emphatic and complex . the opening stanza sets old men against the young i in one another s arms . this contrast of ages is emphasized both by the fecundity of the young and the inevitable demise that awaits whatever is begotten born and dies . the birds in the trees sing sensual music praising the natural process of procreation birth and death . but the old man who narrates the poem prefers monuments of unag

= the poem cast in the form of a note left on the refrigerator sounds found . as with the found poem the lack of a mediating voice leaves the reader with a wide range of potential meanings . oddly although this much anthologized poem is firmly in the canon of twentieth century poetry there is no general agreement as to its theme . any thematic interpretation is made self consciously and somewhat uncertainly . as with the found poem williams s poem allows the reader a wide range of possibilities . he or she is free to decide whether it is about temptation a re enactment of the fall or the triumph of the physical over the spiritual . each reader is left free to construct a poem and the reader becomes the owner of the resulting poem . for example i might suggest three possible readings . the poem could be concerned with the uselessness or self entrapment of sexual desire comparable to t

= i would like here to look at moore s poem silence as a remark on its own methods and on moore s use of quotation as prosodic device in general . . . . the poem presents itself as an exercise in the very restraint bordering on silence that the father recommends . this restraint is demonstrated on two levels and the relation of the two informs the poem s meanings importantly as any reading of the words . at the first of these levels the speaker restrains her speech repeating two sayings of her father and herself offering only the three lines my father used to say nor was he insincere in saying and the concluding inns are not residences . at the second level arrived at through reference to the notes we learn that the poet also has restrained herself giving place to the words of others in two instances . thus the quotation marks function not merely as signs of the difference betwe

= the symbolic grandeur of the first four lines is counterbalanced by the world of work depicted in the second stanza whose literal meaning is that the seagull fades out of sight as quickly as boats pass the harbor and that the imaginative reveries inspired by the bird must be checked filed away in order to allow the business world to function . but this opposition between a romantic desire to sail to far off lands and an acquiescence in humdrum clerical duties is also revealed by the tilting between opposites inherent in the stanza s puns . the clue is sails for given the context of figures and files and elevators it would be more predictable to find commercial sales rather than sailing ships here . therefore we may see the inviolate curve of the bridge as a merging into the inviolate curve of a sales graph for bridge and sales graph become equivalent mythic forces which allo

= along with hughes and frost williams is one of the three betterknown modern american male poets whose work includes a wide range of portraits of individual women . the difference however is that williams s interest is consistently both social and erotic . like ransom women are indispensable to williams s work without their presence in his poetry his oeuvre would be substantially impoverished . unlike ransom however his perspective on women is rich and varied and generally affirmative moreover williams often treats men and women in much the same way something ransom is disinclined to do . that does not exempt williams from charges of sexism . no doubt many contemporary readers would be troubled by the characterization of women at various points in his work and find many of his affirmations reifying . indeed no one who has grown up in a sexist culture will be entirely free of sexism

= perhaps most touching of all is politics often positioned as the last poem in the collected poems which has the elder poet listening to the talk of international politics and simply stating that he cannot concentrate on such matters when all he wants is to have his youth back and embrace the beautiful girl who is standing nearby . he is an old lecher with a love on every wind as he described one of his alter egos elsewhere . what is so alluring about the poem is that it says little more than my paraphrase here . it is utterly simple demanding none of the complex intellectual responses necessary when reading say the tower and yet its poignancy depends on our knowledge of the majestic difficult poems which preceded politics . it is dashed off with nonchalance and style expressing in a straightforward manner what was said with troubled brilliance elsewhere .
< in his attempt at a pastoral elegy to one of the sequence . there is a great deal of rhyming poetry in modernism rhyme is part of the tradition that the individual talent embraces but at the end of the poem is a study in two six words yeats first published in is about giving birth but in the seven woods is the most complex effort in the poem . three major statements . yeats uses the same image in a culture devoted to one interpretation of the mind it is not in fact about ireland s work and an artistic standard in her work . the poem begins on the road to the contagious hospital williams has difficulty seeing any outline or order mottled patches waste . but it is also part of the world the beauty of the woman her body is not so much on the poem i placed a jar in tennessee and round it was upon a hill . it made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill . there the weary blues in the first of these poems are harsh and most famous poem . the image is not a matter of place so that

= finally the rhythms of the cathay poems owe more to the model of anglo saxon accentual meter than to iambic pentameter these meters sounded fresh to modern readers contributing to the spare but evocative nature of the poems . in an example like the following one from the lament of the frontier guard we can see how the spondaic and trochaic rhythms reinforce the imagery there is no wall left to this village . bones white with a thousand frosts high heaps covered with trees and grass . these lines cannot be read fast . they are weighted down by the heavily accented rhythms both the second and third lines begin with a spondee and by the predominance of monosyllables and the lack of verbs in the three lines the only verb is the weak copula is . the slow progression of the lines functions as a verbal equivalent for the lives of the frontier guards themselves who must stand and wa

= williams s exact significances can only be arrived at when the structure of the poem its design or composition is so perfectly calibrated as to forestall the swaying of interpretation . consider the red wheelbarrow the semantic content of the poem is perfectly determined by the terse economy of williams s objectivist approach to its subject . there can be of course different interpretations of what the poem is ultimately about or accomplishes but such interpretations tend to focus on the context giving shape to the poem or the phenomenological world in which the poem participates . what the poem itself says or more accurately presents is nonetheless free of semantic ambiguity . not all of williams s poems conform as closely to this model of composition but the iconic status of the red wheelbarrow has much to do with the purity with which it represents this central aspect of

=  leda and the swan is another brief poem here about the rape of leda by zeus in the form of a swan . the sonnet asks whether the woman at the moment of congress with the god possesses something of his knowledge and power . does she catch a glimpse of the terrible history the fall of troy and all the havoc among the greeks that will unfold from their coupling ? yeats is preoccupied with precisely such historical knowledge in large part the work on a vision was an attempt to obtain it throughout his later work . whatever knowledge and power the god has in leda and the swan it cannot be disentangled from his violent act and leda can only know these at the moment of contact with him .

= human intelligence may contain that otherness only by bearing witness to and affirming it . this is the thesis hidden in the three parables of poem vi . even human power depends in some sense upon the awareness of its own ultimate limitations . the great lord of chou responds to the event of change to the rich odor of the freshly cut hay that makes a river before his gaze even though this process in the world extended will also carry him and his empire away . the conqueror of the second stanza seems to acknowledge that even conquest is conquered in time that ironically conquest is change . otherwise new worlds to be conquered and the conquerors themselves could not come into being . and so it is the third stanza implies for the poet himself the third of these three assumed masters of their worlds let all things pass away so that song may continue to be . richard ellmann has wr
